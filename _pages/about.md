During my Ph.D. I worked as a postdoc at TuDelft-KNMI-VU PIPP project "High Resolution to Exploit Nitrogen Chemical Compound Observations from Space in the Netherlands" (2021---2024). 

In 2024 I received my PhD in Applied Mathematics/Mathematical Engineering TuDelft in Delft, the Netherlands and in Universidad EAFIT, Medellin, Colombia with the thesis entitled Data assimilation in a LOTOS-EUROS chemical transport model for Colombia using satellite measurements.

From 2015-2016 I did a MsC in Applied Physics Universidad EAFIT, Medellin Colombia and From 2006--2014 I studied in Physics in Universidad de Antioquia, Medellin Colombia (2006--2009) not finishing due and later studied Physical Engineering in Universidad EAFIT, Medellin Colombia (2010--2014). 
 

I the 24-12-1987 in Medellin, Colombia. Due to my father's work my family lived in Bogotá from 1994--2005 and I went to primary school in Colegio Italiano Leonardo Da Vinci, Bogotá Colombia (1994--2000) and in Colegio Padre Manyanet, Medellin Colombia (2001--2005) once my family moved back to Medellin.

My work uses data assimilation (DA) techniques to integrate large-scale numerical models, satellite information, and data from different sources. DA techniques play a fundamental role in improving the system states that represent meteorological or chemical atmospheric conditions. This allows us to incorporate different real observations into the models, taking advantage of these two sources of information: observations and mathematical models.

Different Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites have been carrying sensors to monitor NO2 atmospheric concentrations since 1964. From Paul J. Crutzen's idea of having spectrometers onboard satellites, an open field in the study of atmospheric chemical composition was created. Chronologically appeared the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME, (1996-2003), GOME2A (2007-), GOME2B (2013-)), the Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric Cartography (SCIAMACHY, 2002e2012), and the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). Each instrument generation has improved different data characteristics in the measured spectra, solving ratios and signal-to-noise problems and increasing spatial and temporal resolution.
